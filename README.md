## Development

2. Configure the `.env` file.

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Generate a key for cookie signing (TODO: Better way to use keys).

   ```sh
   openssl genrsa -out server/src/cookie.key 2048
   ```

4. Start the PostgreSQL and Redis server.

   ```sh
   podman-compose up -d
   ```

5. Run migrations.

   ```sh
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

6. Start the server.

   Watch mode:

   ```sh
   cargo leptos watch
   ```

   Serve mode:

   ```sh
   cargo leptos serve
   ```
